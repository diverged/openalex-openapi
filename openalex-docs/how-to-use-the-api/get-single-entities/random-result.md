You can get a random result by using the string `random` where an ID would normally go. OMG that's so random! Each time you call this URL you'll get a different entity.  Examples:

* Get a random institution:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/institutions/random`](https://api.openalex.org/institutions/random)
* Get a random concept:\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/concepts/random`](https://api.openalex.org/concepts/random)
