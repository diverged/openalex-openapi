# Topic object

These are the fields in a topic object. When you use the API to get a [single topic](../topics/get-a-single-topic.md) or [lists of topics](../topics/get-lists-of-topics.md), this is what's returned.

### `description`

_String:_ A description of this topic, [generated by AI](./README.md).

```json
description: "This cluster of papers explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, focusing on applications in healthcare, medical imaging, clinical decision support, and the ethical challenges associated with AI implementation. It delves into topics such as machine learning, big data, precision medicine, and the potential impact of AI on health equity."
```

### `display_name`

_String:_ The English-language label of the topic.

```json
display_name: "Artificial Intelligence in Medicine"
```

### `domain`

_Object:_ The ID and the name (`display_name`) for the _domain_ of this topic. The domain is the highest level in the "domain, field, subfield, topic" system, which means it is the least granular. See the [topics overview](./README.md) for more explanation and a diagram.

```json
domain: {
    id: 4,
    display_name: "Health Sciences"
}
```

### `field`

_Object:_ The ID and the name (`display_name`) for the _field_ of this topic. The field is the second-highest level in the "domain, field, subfield, topic" system, which means it is the second-least granular. See the [topics overview](./README.md) for more explanation and a diagram.

```json
field: {
    id: 27,
    display_name: "Medicine"
}
```

### `id`

_String:_ The OpenAlex ID for this topic.

```json
id: "https://openalex.org/T11636"
```

### `ids`

_Object:_ All the external identifiers that we know about for this topic. IDs are expressed as URIs whenever possible. Possible ID types:

* `openalex` (_String:_ this topic's [OpenAlex ID](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-single-entities/README.md#the-openalex-id). Same as [`Topic.id`](#id))
* `wikipedia` (_String:_ this topic's Wikipedia page URL)

```json
ids: {
    openalex: "https://openalex.org/T11636",
    wikipedia: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare"
}
```

### `keywords`

_List:_ Keywords consisting of one or several words each, meant to represent the content of the papers in the topic. These keywords were generated as part of the [AI model](README.md). For now, they are provided as-is, but we will be providing more support and documenting them more thoroughly.

```json
keywords: [
    "Artificial Intelligence",
    "Machine Learning",
    "Healthcare",
    "Medical Imaging",
    "Clinical Decision Support",
    ...
]
```

### `subfield`

_Object:_ The ID and the name (`display_name`) for the _subfield_ of this topic. The subfield is the third-highest level in the "domain, field, subfield, topic" system, which means it is the third-least granular. See the [topics overview](./README.md) for more explanation and a diagram.

```json
subfield: {
    id: 2718,
    display_name: "Health Informatics"
}
```

### `updated_date`

_String:_ The last time anything in this topic object changed, expressed as an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601) date string. This date is updated for _any change at all_, including increases in various counts.

```json
updated_date: "2024-02-05T05:00:03.798420"
```

### `works_count`

_Integer:_ The number of works tagged with this topic.

```json
works_count: 21737
