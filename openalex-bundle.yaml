        Groups the results by a specified property. The response will include a `group_by` object with counts for each group.

        You can group by most of the same properties that you can filter by.

        To include the "unknown" group in the response, add `:include_unknown` after the group-by parameter.

        Example: `group_by=authorships.institutions.id` or `group_by=authorships.institutions.id:include_unknown`

        The response will contain:
        - `key`: The OpenAlex ID or raw value of the `group_by` parameter for members of this group.
        - `key_display_name`: The `display_name` or raw value of the `group_by` parameter for members of this group.
        - `count`: The number of entities in the group.
