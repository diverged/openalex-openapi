Our publisher data is closely tied to the publisher information in Wikidata. So the [Canonical External ID](../../how-to-use-the-api/get-single-entities/#canonical-external-ids) for OpenAlex publishers is a Wikidata ID, and almost every publisher has one. Publishers are linked to sources through the [`host_organization`](../sources/source-object.md#host\_organization) field.
